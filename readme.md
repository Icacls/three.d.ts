#### TypeScript interface for three.js ####

This porject is based on [three.js](http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/) r53.

Most definition of the classes were completed. It needs checking, brushing up and testing.

### Usage (for beginners of TypeScript)

1. Download three.js ([three.js r53](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/archive/r53.zip) is recommended) and unzip it.
2. Download [three.d.ts](https://github.com/kontan/three.d.ts/raw/master/three.d.ts) and place it at any directory.
3. Create your TypeScript source file. 
4. Write the following special comment at the top of your source file:

     &lt;reference path="relative/path/to/three.d.ts" /&gt;

5. Write your application. If you want to API reference, watch [official API reference](http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/docs/53/) or open three.d.ts directory. (The official document asserts that it's "r53" reference but a little out of date. Currently, autogenerated reference is not provided because there is no document generator for TypeScript. )
5. Compile your code.
6. Create your html file to invoke the generated JavaScript source code. Dont't forget to refer both of three.js and yourcode.js from your html source file.
6. Open the html file. If your application doesn't work, [source maps](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/) is useful to debug.  

Enjoy three.js!
